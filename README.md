Haskell PNM Viewer
==================

The PNM format is beautiful. Never before have I seen such a simple practical format.

[Here is the specification.]{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm\_format}

Wow, typing that link would probably have taken longer than giving an informal specification...

Why isn't this format available on everything ever?

The one program I found that could play with PNM files nicely was
[ToyViewer]{http://www7a.biglobe.ne.jp/~ogihara/software/OSX/toyv-eng.html}
which is OS X only.
